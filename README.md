# 🛍️ Customer Segmentation - Data Visualization Mini Project

This project explores a customer dataset to understand purchasing behavior using data visualization techniques like histograms and statistical summaries.

## 📊 Objective

The goal is to visually analyze customer features such as **Age**, **Annual Income**, and **Spending Score** using:

- Histograms with KDE plots
- Summary statistics

## 🗃️ Dataset

We use a dataset named `customers.csv` stored inside the `data/` folder. It contains the following columns:

| Column Name               | Description                          |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `CustomerID`              | Unique ID for each customer          |
| `Gender`                  | Customer gender                      |
| `Age`                     | Age of the customer                  |
| `Annual Income (k$)`      | Yearly income in thousands of dollars|
| `Spending Score (1-100)`  | Score assigned based on behavior     |
